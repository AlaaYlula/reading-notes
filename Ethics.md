# Ethics
Computer ethics is a part of practical philosophy concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct.  
  
**Ethics in the workplace**

Sometimes companies focus on profit and promoting certain products, regardless of their effects.  
The programmer is mainly associated with promoting the products of these companies, as it is the basis for building the site that publishes these products, so he must be aware of the effects of these products and ensure that products meet the highest professional standards possible, especially if they have a direct impact on the health of the user.  
In my opinion, the programmer from the beginning had to search for the product that the company was promoting and its effects, and when he noticed their promotion of a product with bad health effects, he had to express his opinion and take an action.

Despite the benefits of using self-driving cars, such as boosting economic productivity and reducing urban congestion, the risks must be considered when using this technology.    
It is difficult to create software without any bugs, and this technology needs some sort of internet connectivity for its functionality or completely relies on outside sensors for making all decisions, So it is easily get hacked. You must ensure that the technology you adopt has protections in place, apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results and test AI technologies in constrained environments, and monitor their operation after deployment. You’ll be well on your way to practicing ethical tech.
