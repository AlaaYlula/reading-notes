# The Growth Mindset
People with a growth mindset think that their basic abilities can be developed and improved through hard work.  
So if you have any difficulty don't give up, just process the error, learn from it and try again.  

The idea is the individuals must step outside of their comfort zone to learn something new and tough, so their brain's neurons build new, stronger connections, and they become better over time.  
The **Growth Mindset** is used to build the **Grit** which is Passion and commitment for very long-term objectives, as well as working extremely hard to make those goals a reality.
