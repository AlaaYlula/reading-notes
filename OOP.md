## Java Object and Class ( Java is an object-oriented programming language )
  
> What is the **object**
>> Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects, and it is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class.  
>> Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. The state of an object is stored in fields (state variables), while methods (functions,behaviors) display the object's behavior.
