# Notifications

## Allowing Other Apps to Start Your Activity 
In some Applications when we need to share, the app appears as an option in the chooser dialog.  
We need to add an **<intent-filter>** element in the manifest file for the corresponding <activity> element.  
And for the **intent-filter** can specifies only one action and one data type.  
  
## Intent types
1. Explicit Intents: Android calling one activity from another activity and pass information.  
2. Implicit Intents: doesnâ€™t specify the component.
