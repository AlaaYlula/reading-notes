## What is the Purely functional programming
Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state. A pure functional subroutine only has visibility of changes of state represented by state variables included in its scope.  

## What is the Difference between pure and impure functional programming
Pure functional programming languages donâ€™t allow any mutability in its nature whereas a functional style language provides higher-order functions but often permits mutability at the risk of we failing to do the right things, which put a burden on us rather than protecting us. So, in general, we can say if a language provides higher-order function it is functional style language, and if a language goes to the extent of limiting mutability in addition to higher-order function then it becomes purely functional language. Java is a functional style language and the language like Haskell is a purely functional programming language.
